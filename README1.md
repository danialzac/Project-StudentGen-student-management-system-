# StudentGen – Student Management System

## Overview
StudentGen is a Java console-based application that manages students, courses, and grades.
It allows users to register students, enroll them in courses, assign grades, and view
summaries through a menu-driven interface.

This project was created as part of a Java Programming Fundamentals assessment and
demonstrates core Java and object-oriented programming concepts.

## Features
- Register new students
- Find students by ID
- Enroll students into courses
- Assign grades to enrolled courses
- View summaries of students and courses

## Project Structure
The project follows a standard Java package structure and separates responsibilities
into different layers:

src/
└── com.generation
├── model
│ ├── Student.java
│ └── Course.java
│
├── service
│ ├── StudentService.java
│ └── CourseService.java
│
├── utils
│ └── PrinterHelper.java
│
└── Main.java

### Package Explanation
- **model**  
  Contains the core data classes such as `Student` and `Course`. These represent the
  main entities of the system.

- **service**  
  Contains the business logic of the application. Classes such as `StudentService`
  and `CourseService` manage operations like enrollment, grading, and summaries.

- **utils**  
  Contains helper classes used for printing menus and handling user interaction.

- **Main**  
  The entry point of the application. It displays the menu, reads user input, and
  calls the appropriate service methods.

## Compiled Output
- The `out/production` directory is automatically generated by the IDE.
- It contains compiled `.class` files and should not be modified manually.

## How to Run the Application
1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or any Java-compatible IDE.
2. Locate the `Main` class inside the `src/com/generation` package.
3. Run the `Main` class.
4. Follow the on-screen menu instructions.
5. Enter student IDs and course codes when prompted.

## Technologies Used
- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- JUnit 5 (for unit testing)

## Notes
- The application runs entirely in the console.
- Data is stored in memory during runtime.
- All input should follow the prompts shown in the men
